This version of 2048 is built with React from a previous vanilla JS build I made (can be found here: https://github.com/TimeForZeros/Game-2048)

### Features in Progress

This version of the game is connected to a MongoDB server where entered scores can be uploaded. A leaderboard is in progress to showcase the players with the top 10 scores.
